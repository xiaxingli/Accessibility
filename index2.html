              Brightness accessibility can refer to features that help adjust
              screen brightness and color to improve visibility and reduce eye
              strain: <br /><br />
              Auto-brightness: Automatically adjusts the screen brightness based
              on the lighting conditions. <br />
              Night Shift: Shifts the display's color to a warmer spectrum at
              night to make it easier to read. <br />
              White Point: Reduces the display's white point.

              Color is one of the most important elements of a webpage. It can
              attract users and assist in conveying information. Ensuring
              websites have high enough contrast between the foreground and the
              background is significant. Users with color vision impairments or
              low visibility may find difficulty in viewing an item with low
              color contrast.<br /><br />
              Sufficient color contrast should be provided (at least 4.5:1
              ratio) for regular text. If the text is large, a color contrast
              ratio of 3:1 can be provided. Black text on a white background has
              the highest readability. Warm and cold colors make for the best
              color contrast. Use color palettes to find correct color contrast
              combinations. Viget provides users with a pallet of different
              types of tints, tones, and shades.

            Tritanopia is a condition where a person cannot distinguish between

            Tritanopia have normal red and green vision. Tritanopia is often
            referred to as color blindness.

              The ADA compliant font list includes, but is not limited to:

              Motion blur, while often used for aesthetic purposes in games and
              design, can be a significant accessibility concern, particularly
              for people experiencing motion sickness, as it can exacerbate
              dizziness and discomfort; therefore, most modern games and
              interfaces offer the option to disable or adjust the level of
              motion blur within accessibility settings, allowing users to
              customize the visual experience based on their needs.
              <br /><br />
              Motion blur can trigger nausea and discomfort in individuals
              sensitive to visual movement, especially when present in
              fast-paced games or animations. Providing users with the ability
              to customize the level of motion blur is crucial for inclusivity
              and ensuring a comfortable experience.

                Alt text, or alternative text, is a written description of an
                image. It allows people with visual impairments to understand
                the content of images using screen readers. It also makes
                content accessible to people who have difficulty understanding
                visual content or who don't have access to high-speed internet.
                <br /><br />
                Here are some tips for writing effective alt text: Be accurate
                and give a good understanding of what's going on Be short and
                sweet Include context Include text that's part of the image Keep
                it free of spelling and grammar mistakes Avoid including "image
